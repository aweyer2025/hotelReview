 May 16 2005 	 Three Star Hotel Three Star Price 	 four star property . rate guide book 2 star , would say worthy 3 star . the name Hilton Euston might first conjure something little grander mind , location give clue go par Hilton Park Lane . overseas visitor forgive ignorance . price North America also generally low , . bargain hotel , offer fair deal reassurance reputable brand name . I often post review Trip Advisor vent anger feel axe grind , feel pay , motivation today positive . many rip off London please find place stay offer degree value . also help karma account ! room 3rd floor , spotlessly clean , simply yet functionally furnish . single bed might everyone 's taste , business trip also spend time room son student London , , trapping upscale property require . miss , expect , certainly pay they . the bathroom modern , room air conditioning , something many hotel property 's league price without , U.K. , least London . breakfast usual standard fare , service adequate , even though staff busy . I pay £ 109.00 include vat room , Hilton 's reservation service . notice reviewer comment rate exclude taxis , seem somewhat foolish check first , travel , particularly visit foreign country . Las Vegas hotel add sort extra , even energy taxis , think pretty well U.K. misleading . would stay ? possibly , noise traffic little discomforting sound night 's sleep , feel get fair deal , think case get pay for . other hotel use trip good , pay £ 90.00 ........... put cramp room , sag bed , date furnshing , staff could speak English !
