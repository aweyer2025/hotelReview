East oppose West coast , people smoke , would crack window room -- smoky air come hallway . room clean , queen size bed , nightstand , chair , iron ironing board small closet , huge tv cable ( interesting view overlook typical postage stamp size back yard ) . staff friendly , helpful , accomodating , , other stay hotel . hayden great location : Central Park right outside door subway short walk away . feel absolutely safe come back Village late night ( early a.m. case may ) . also , one need & quot ; emergency & quot ; clothing ( luggage lose , dress not seem right occasion ) , Filene 's Basement right corner Broadway . highly recommend shopping bargin . bottom line : satisfied would definitely stay Hayden .
