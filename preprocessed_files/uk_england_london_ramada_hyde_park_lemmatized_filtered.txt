 Apr 19 2005 	 Great Location 	 brother stay week Ramada Hyde Park March 13th-19th 2005 . staff friendly helpful . breakfast buffet offer great selection food quite tasty . the room nice size & amp ; bathroom nice long bath tub . however , bathroom not bathtub want one , need request . location good part hotel . 's close Queensway & amp ; Notting Hill Gate train station . able take train airport close hotel inexpensive . Hyde Park right across hotel Kensington Palace within walking distance . many bus stop front near hotel . 2 lovely church side street hotel . be within walking distance many store , restaurant , thrift shop , Portabello Market , etc . overall , hotel could use remodeling , location amenity make shortcoming hotel . also , hotel lovely neighborhood . would definitely stay . 
 Apr 8 2005 	 good experience except elevator 	 will agree several comment post early . appear recently renovate room 6th floor back hotel . small american standard , well many place ' ve stay London . negative elevator ( completely one day could never call 6th floor ... ever ... would go one floor call elevator .... figure couple day walk six flight whenever leave room ) . one morning wait breakfast excessively long ( 20 minute get seat ) . Checkin breeze , dining room pretty unorganized . the location great , one word warning be stay next month . Central Line tube train run weekend Acton Town ( think ) Oxford Circus . thus bus run along Regent / Oxford / Kensington PACKED ! be think stay weekend rely tube , might check London Transport website see weekend closure still effect .
