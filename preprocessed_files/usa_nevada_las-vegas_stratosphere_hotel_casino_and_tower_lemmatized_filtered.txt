 may 25 2009 	 good price 	 Stratosphere among cheap stay visit Las Vegas - , old saying go , get pay for . probably Stratosphere 's big drawback ' location . technically strip , far northern end , close casino ( Sahara ) couple block away . area Sahara Stratosphere bit dicey night ( winos , panhandler , hooker , etc . ) be old young kid , probably want avoid walk around . I personally not problem local color around Stratosphere , find use monorail ( access Sahara ) quickly cheaply get southern area strip . want go downtown ( Fremont Street ) catch Deuce ( public bus ) time day night . ride slow , bus safe , $ 3 , quite bit cheap take taxi . the standard room not anything special , around $ 25 night , not expect Ritz . bed comfortable , bathroom keep clean . be likely get much view , selection tv limit , come Vegas go , sit hotel room day . one thing though - maitenance department need improve . five - day stay , two , room clean even though put & quot ; please make room & quot ; placard . use dish , laundry , etc , would often sit hallway hour time . also , afternoon room try catch nap , clean person keep run vacuum directly outside door , clearly & quot ; disturb & quot ; placard it . the rest staff well , though . not problem check - take 10 minute get line get room key - checking via tv breeze . the bartender , particular , good , recommend good place hit , quick comp drink throw buck poker machine . main bar , C Bar , happy hour get unlimited drink 4 - 8 pm $ 20 , good way get lube cheap heading night . I not gamble much , can not really give many specific casino section . surprisingly small , though , compare strip casino , think sport book look kind dumpy . talk people stay Stratosphere , apparently not high payout . the show offer , american superstar ( celebrity impersonator ) Bite ( topless vampire - theme show ) , seem cheesy even Vegas standard , not bother . Stratosphere 's main attraction observation deck , offer awesome view Vegas , thrill ride , extremely fun be scare height . I would also recommend Top World restaurant , go lunch unless want shell $ 100 per person . dining option locate little shopping mall second floor . fairly nondescript , good way get good cheap eat - especially mexican place , get big burrito beer around $ 8.overall , Stratosphere not good casino / hotel strip , price , be perfectly acceptable . 's nice place sleep , shower , grab quick bite couple drink head get & quot ; real & quot ; Vegas experience .
