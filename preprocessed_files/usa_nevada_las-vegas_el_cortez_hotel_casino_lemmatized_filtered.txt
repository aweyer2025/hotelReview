change 	 stay downtown 2 - 3 time per year last 6 year , 6 year ago never think El Cortez would even consideration stay . dump , dirty delapidate , somewhat scary part downtown , 2 block east Fremont Street Experience . clientele seem fit place perfectly . smoke pour casino door open ( smoke notice haze inside ) foul odor hang air . over year , would drop moment curiousity . notice , unlike downtown property fall decay , El Cortez spiffe up . early year , convince well half come . vow 6 yr early never . end spend 3 hour , shocked turnaround ( still skeptical ) .We get offer stay new Cabana Suites ( agree would go elsewhere not decent , well research remodel , etc . web showing ) book , opt Tower room Suites non - smoking . ' m glad , Cabana Suites also across street , attach main building . the change superficial . service excellent around . book give we room number . arrive hour check - in time room ready ( room number give we month early ) . see smudge print elevator panel , anywhere ( although pet peeve mine , nearly every property nice big furnish hall exit elevator knicke good maid vacuum not touch . ) . room large , clean ( fear barefoot property ) well appoint . flat screen tv , big enough . except tv , look like picture website ( believe , many property room ) . bathroom kinda small , not problem . electronic safe mount near floor closet area . will not find amenity already place room , be available , call . need hairdryer offer bring frig well . not see happen often . old noisy heat / cool unit floor window . output air intake vent ceiling control wall near door . old ' popcorn ' ceiling . gambling fun , great mix new old machine ( still coin payout , old Vegas ) limit low table ( $ 3 BJ 3/2 25 cent roulette $ 1 minimum ) nice hit cold streak . casino clean times 3 + day stay . common see maintenance people pick around place , floor people , server , security well . machine wipe trash empty cup / bottle lay round . air clear odor . Carpet floor clean . fellow patron friendly , loyal following . we eat day Cafe Cortez . great food lot cheap ( frig come handy leftover ) . yes , Jackie around , eat next table Sunday morning . not try Flame hot dog cart , hear good . not want stop gambling eat , service deliver food . forgot try , see many people use it . there still character , 's typical downtown . security abundant , inside . see disturbance . short walk experience plenty safe , day night . walk one night Binion 's eat coffee shop ( sure glad , unfortunately go couple week ) problem . fact , enjoy El Cortez much , time leave property . bottom line , El Cortez rank # 2 far downtown property go ( Golden Nugget # 1 , much expensive ) . look hip crowd expensive dud , go GN . like we , average work class people , EC place go . 
 's ok returning 	 get room tower . room clean ( enough ) roomy sitting room . however , not like bathroom - kinda old tub slope . sink outside bathroom also slanty little counter space 's low . bad thing ventilation hotel - can not stay away smoke , even non - smoking room . air casino quite bad , even restaurant . section coin - operate slot machine think old - timer preferred substance sound coin . try restaurant hotel alright decent price . friend get room Expedia $ 42 / night , 3 - night stay special . room situate top parking structure 5th floor ( think convert ) , kinda weird new furnishing decor room . 's suitable look good price . finally , must mention El Cortez 2 parking structure , one attach , one detach . also separate building ( El Cortez Cabana Suites ) across street . excellent location want Fremont Street Experience . everthing ok stay , usually look comfort excitement probably will not return .
