 Feb 22 2004 	 reasonable value money 	 find hotel acceptable price pay , London expensive city & amp ; hotel price reflect . room small , bright & amp ; cheerfully decorate include every thing would require include iron & amp ; board . bathroom small bath shower . Breakfast & amp ; service good , dining room large second room open . find staff friendly & amp ; concerned opinion . location hotel , city experience area around railway station quite often less glamorous . tourist destination research need do ensure location meet need . visit London tourist personally would stay central location .

 Jan 23 2004 	 bad other say 	 everyone individual taste experience , regular hotel user stay twice , would say unexcite ok hotel . first choice acceptable price right ( £ 60 last stay ) . woudl imagine room overlook main road noisy though . also , whilst surrounding bit edgy , you re use urban environment dangerous other suggest - fair number people street indeed quite pleasant pub restaurant around . need observant without get paranoid ( apply smart area london also ) .
