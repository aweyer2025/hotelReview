Booked junior suite ( good internet rate Opodo ) . check - in , allocate superior room ( accidentally ? ? ) , quickly change suite point error . room large clean , marble bathroom large bath separate shower . criticism sit area drafty ( nice view ) heating / airconditione noisy mind 's ! apart hotel cosy little bar provide good complimentary breakfast also one free glass champagne . ideally situate Macy 's , Empire State Times Square , elevator arrive promptly unlike Hilton ! Staff seem friendly enough , would definitely consider stay .
