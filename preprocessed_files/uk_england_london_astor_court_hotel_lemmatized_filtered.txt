 Nov 15 2005 	 pleasantly surprised ! 	 pleasantly surprised quality fine hotel reading review Trip Advisor .... friend stay couple week ago great , especially price ! location could beat -- not get central Oxford Circus price ... one safe neighbourhood , right nearthe business district ( pople claim area unsafe obviously not dodgy part London ! ) .. picadilly Circus fifteen minute walk , shop immediate area fantastic ... could walk major attraction 25 minute less ... could certainly walk hotel alone midnight without concern . the hotel process renovate ( floor 4 5 complete ; stay 4th floor ) renos good ( mustiness whatsoever ) . cleanliness hotel fantastic ( stay much fancy hotel less pride cleaning practice ) , staff absolutely lovely -- even make room ahead schedule upon check could take much needed nap . breakfast simple , realistic -- & quot ; BREAKFAST . look something , pay it . I would stay hotel without hesitation .
