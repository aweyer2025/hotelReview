 Jul 15 2005 	 positive impression - wait come back 	 travel London quite frequently tourist . year try hotel never get good vaue money Parkside Hotel , stay 6 - 7 time far . Most room ensuite bathroom recent stay room top floor share bathroom ( never see hear guest ) . climb stair 3rd floor surprise spacious room nice view London happy choice save we 12 pound per night compare ensuite - room . the staff always friendly helpful , either reception breakfast . talk breakfast - gorgeous , excellent choice cook English breakfast plus various cereal , toast , marmelade , jam etc .... always find place clean tidy notice renovation do recently . unfortunately one quieter place , situate busy road . however , location ideal travel different airport , either Heathrow , Standstead Gatwick walk minute tube bus station . tube take centre main tourist attraction within 15 minute . even though several hotel road would call tourist area . area mix , people shop different cultural background view contribute liveliness vital feeling London . park opposite road functional , find local resident rest , play playground , compete football exercise sport field . I highly recommend hotel definitely stay next holiday London .

 Jan 21 2004 	 Decent enough 	 's competitor Claridge 's , Parkside Hotel decent enough budget hotel . room eave top floor , oddly shape surprisingly spacious clean . washbasin , toilet bathtub - oddly , shower - adjacent room , far could tell share guest room . believe many room full in - room facility , however ( mine least expensive house . ) staff seem friendly enough , small lounge , gym bar , no - extra - cost breakfast quite nice . main criticism Parkside Hotel location . 's noisy street rather dreary outlying part London ; area around Finsbury Park tube station , minute ' walk hotel , pretty close ghetto . take Piccadilly Line tube ( fare zone 2 ) Manor House station keep one bad area involve travel time London 's main tourist attraction people may prefer .
