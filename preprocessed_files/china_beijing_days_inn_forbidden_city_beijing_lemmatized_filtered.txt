( base review ) specifically book deluxe room view adjoining Hutong . however one tell reception room available check . tell would move later day available . week still room start . perfectly comfortable room , small . bathroom almost big bedroom . basically say something going happen someone ensure happen . also book system able record request front desk staff know requested.3 . European New Years Eve ask front desk locally could go celebrate . tell do not know foreign tourist be not major market . ironically ring another hotel use previously Beijing give we list activity also arrange New Year trip we free charge ! surely must central visitor information record thing could post lobby . even well task member staff good english keep date offer alternative guest look thing . sell people tour commission could even make hotel money . do not get start promote overseas market ! 4 . room service problem pay price plus additional service charge . however adjoining cafe / restaurant also 10 % service fee anything order , even soft drink . thought could build price item , however price already pretty steep compare adjoining restaurant . glass local beer effectively cost 30rmb service fee , yet bottle ( maybe three glass ) 25 - 35rmb many local restaurant little 5 rmb shop next door . do not even breakfast 68rmb pay meal two nearby . main course evening ( 150 - 190rmb ) would cost we pay two course meal drink another restaurant ( 130rmb ) .5 . try take taxi forecourt often quote high price set . example trip drum tower two taxi drivers forecourt want 50rmb fee . walk flag one outside pay 18rmb meter . seem small scam driver park foyer charge foreigner excessively . so would recommend day Inn Forbidden City other ? yes , guess good place good team . people ideal .
