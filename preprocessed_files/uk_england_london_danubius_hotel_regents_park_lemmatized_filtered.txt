I would also say find house restaurant disappointing ; clear change afoot perhaps food quality improve . Suffice say , one evening meal disappointing ( would recommend Richaux Sofras St. John 's Wood alternative ) ; expensive ( suggest alternative also expensive , least food good ) . breakfast include room rate go elsewhere : think £ 15 per head breakfast outrageous , even four star hotel . the Danubis trapping potential good hotel ; sure long current owner 's hand , think get well . certainly every member staff encounter try helpful ( despite aforementione language difficulty ) , think , establishment 's good asset .
