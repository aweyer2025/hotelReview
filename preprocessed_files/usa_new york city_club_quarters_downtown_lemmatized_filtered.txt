 Mar 27 2005 	 Boring Budget Beds 	 well , check - in ' m surprised corporation would use hotel anything junior staff .... like corp dorm ... HBO anything basic channel , full sized bed , desk chair low can not really type ... carpet like sandpaper - bring slipper keep sock .... room clean furnishing dull minimal ... plenty hot water evening ... bath ok room . I ' m one night - ok .. anyone stay long , consider somewhere else ... especially weekend ... nothing open unless walk Broadway McDonalds . I get room less $ 100 priceline ... select downtown last resort .... will not ... whatever save room will spend transportation get somewhere ... although could walk south street seaport even chinatown ... week lot open ... subway access good ... early week stay new hotel QT 45th street - know budget hotel class .... Club Quarters expect something special since ' member ' stay be book one online booking site - find Motel-6 middle financial district .... unless NYC busy , probably find well money ... overall , terrible , nothing adequate ...
