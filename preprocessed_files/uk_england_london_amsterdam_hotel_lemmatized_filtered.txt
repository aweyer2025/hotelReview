 Jan 14 2005 	 fool ... 	 wife stay 6 night Amsterdam Hotel honeymoon look forward quaint cozy place stay ( lead believe base photo early review site ) . arrive quite contrary . the first sign trouble extremely small lift take we fourth floor room ( avoid Room 20 cost ) . lift barely hold two adult ... nevermind luggage likely . room strange . ceiling unusual slope halfway middle making room rather small . absolute bad part & quot ; en suite & quot ; bathroom . not know brit define & quot ; en suite , & quot ; normal human take shower bathroom toilet two foot away water say shower fill entire bathroom separation rest bathroom ... mean guarantee wet bathroom floor shower matter . honestly feel like RV ... SMALL ! ! ! next & quot ; non - smoking & quot ; facility . place tout non - smoking facility , first morning , smell cigarette smoke outside door . think rude guest hotel , notify front desk . get vague , & quot ; oh really ? & quot ; response . become clear not deal hotel guest , employee hotel smoking ! ! ! yes , clean crew / maid / front desk clerk ... smoking . unbelievable.unfortunately , already pay room full way mess ... otherwise , would go far away possible place immediately.the final straw came arrive night return find several people room fix apparently break light switch fuse box . ( thing ... several light room not work . ) could not fix next morning , & quot ; safety hazard & quot ; force stay far superior room ( yes , even less ) reeked sewage ( see review ... probably room ... ROOM 18 ? ) one save grace not pay night.the two positive thing say Amsterdam location earl 's court tube station ( neighborhood bit dodgy ... careful around station ) , complimentary internet access ( though bit temperamental time ) .it be really unfortunate really look forward pleasant place stay ... experience honeymoon times disappointing . state read , would compare place bad Motel 6 room ( Motel 6 room bad go knowing expect . ) not fool photo / review site official site ...
