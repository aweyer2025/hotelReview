 Jan 28 2008 	 word game - surprise 	 compare multiple Theatre District hotel Tripadvisor , choose Belvedere base overwhelming & quot ; good & quot ; review price point . usually use Kayak.com set price benchmark , interestingly enough , Hotel 's website undercut price good $ 20 / night $ 169 / night one night stay King Deluxe room January 26th . when call make reservation , ask recently remodel room receptionist coy give one , say assign room check . little pressure saying would make reservation elsewhere could guarantee specific room , say block & quot ; refurbish & quot ; room . good - deceptive - choice word , would find later . the morning departure , realize make reservation , receptionist ever discuss rate . bad feel pit stomach substantiate call hotel & quot ; confirm & quot ; rate $ 169 ( plus tax ) night . turn , reservation $ 199 / night talk manager get honor online rate ( not even know go check website ) . adddition , ask manager renovate room say $ 75 night go say & quot ; refurbish room & quot ; , apparently mean thing upgrade , include mattress , linen , etc . careful book make sure aware use word hotel ! rate still good one area , keep reservation upon arrival , check experience nothing like experience phone . door open bellhop fiance greet warmly everyone stylish , clean lobby . surprise check room ready within minute arrival . as side note , hotel locate theater district , bit beat path . be bit seedy , could much , much bad . as previous reviewer note , elevator slow , since 16th floor , really not mind wait . hallway 16th floor ( well un - renovated floor ) small , bit date , clean neutral odor . room date expect clean . marble entryway bathroom spotless inviting . linen clean soft view 16th floor ( room 1603 ) actually nice . one noticeable absence however , lack in - room climate control heat ( window A / c unit summer month ) . regardless room comfortably warm regulate temperature use A / C unit 's thermostat keep constant 67 - 68 degree . I bite disappointed find Wi - Fi cost $ 10 24 hour , even charge use business center , note least 4 - 5 unsecured wireless signal laptop able receive - even 16th floor . overall , experience Belveder Hotel unremarkable , meet expectation price pay . surprise - either negatively positively , regret stay either . although give reason try hotel , get solid recommendation reliable , clean stand - by else fail . make sure confirm specific reservation , room type ( renovate vs. refurbish ) rate prior arrival well . on side note , Pigalle , french bistro locate block away excellent restaurant . highly recommend escargot - tasty do like Paris !
