Saha specialize arabic - fusion cuisine , everything eat drink outstanding . say , problem hotel . bathroom door would close completely ( latch short ) screen eighth - floor window , leave mildly acrophobic wife bit terrify stuck head open window see eight - story drop alley ( child beware ) . minor concern , however , not bother we much . significant concern extremely thin wall hotel 's proximity hospital emergency room , mean hear extremely loud siren throughout night . hotel also border San Francisco 's Tenderloin neighborhood , exactly family - friendly . numerous xxx adult establishment near hotel , although great sympathy score homeless indidivual pass , wife little concerned safety occasion . overall , thoroughly enjoy Carlton , poor location ( noise bad neighborhood ) might prompt we look alternative next time be city .
