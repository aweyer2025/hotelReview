Ghostbar 's design flawed make difficult walk around without step . one good thing Ghostbar view outside . room average , bed feature comparable find Excalibur 's standard ( Excalibur like well ) . also quite pain get strip people , luckily face problem rent car . also consider trendy hotel , drink food extremely overpriced . also probably see whole hotel 3 minute . save money folk , ' m twenty single thought would well experience hotel aspect trip . try Hard Rock , well yet stay Strip , will save whole lot time , money , headache . trust say !
