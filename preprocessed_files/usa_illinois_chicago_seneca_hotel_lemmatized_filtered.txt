I find Seneca online Hotwire ( not choose specifically , location star level ) . pleased location -- right Michigan , behind Hancock tower . new visitor city would able easily find way around shopping / touristy part Mag Mile . I think seneca good value . Chicago hotel fairly overprice , value important . front desk staff friendly helpful ask extra key extra pillow . room include sit area fully outfit kitchen , nice breakfast start day . eat restaurant ( although cafe offer free hot breakfast ) use parking service , can not speak . bathroom seem recently update clean . fitness center use , open 24 hour . a drawback -- lobby area chaotic Seneca seem host lot group ( probabaly due good price ) . hotel old , slick modern new property would . elevator slowish small . bed traditional hotel bed , regular queen mattress plain metal frame . slip frame several time ( simply sit bed ) . bedspread old & quot ; SENECA & quot ; write back laundry marker -- big deal , pinnacle sophistication . like able get cab right outside hotel , available seneca . however , problem get one corner next block . overall , nothing wrong hotel , especially tourist interested shopping , sightseeing experience city . prefer hotel relax enjoy luxury amenity , perhaps another property would work well .
