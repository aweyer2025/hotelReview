 may 23 2008 	 find someplace else unless right Chinatown 	 first review brand new property helpful accurate ; ask room opposite side bridge , small room , etc . take advice . balance , review may friendly . well ask concession , etc . ; simply not stay here . I ' m picky hotel , even though ' ve fly million mile ( really ) stay hundred hundred hotel . want hotel clean , quiet , convenient , decent bed pillow , good iron board , shower work properly . basic Hampton Inn Marriott Courtyard absolutely fine . ' m snob . this hotel , funky heart Chinatown , simply not ready , will not likely ever . appear still construction , get scream deal tile . long , hollow hallway lead elevator still largely empty . chinatown exotic interesting , course . be also smelly , filthy crowded , make difficult even get street . hotel not offer warm , welcome respite that . I stay room opposite side hotel subway , yes . window , relatively small , still bit loud . new bed bed , new armoire desk ( buy Walmart ) , new bathroom . shower , 7th floor , guess , & quot ; dribble & quot ; & quot ; shower . & quot ; Water barely come . ridiculous . clean , yes . amenity . one example : iron iron board room , call get one . take 30 minute second call . bad fact relatively new iron board smell terrible ! ! like mold trash ! make shirt smell awful , render unusable . ( be obviously store board closet trash , alley , something . terrible . ) single elevator mean be also go wait sometimes . another problem : difficult get taxi location , subway line convenient . needless say , will not ever stay hotel recommend find another property well - unless be really interested right Chinatown .
