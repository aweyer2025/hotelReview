' ve stay Kitano many occasion , variety room . impression first visit less great , leave feel underwhelmed . couple trip realize point . Kitano not big flashy . rather , oasis middle NYC . take awhile realize hotel exactly set - quiet , efficient without face , friendly stay way . someone else mention , first impression room could use update , later realize pristine , purposely plain . example , take several trip realize wallcovere hallway elegant fabric - nothing call attention . floor cleverly lay never short walk room elevator . hotel security not obvious , yet impression watch problem . bar , second floor overlook Park Avenue , one favorite NY spot . still remember sit window one winter evening watch people walk Park Avenue snow , cab pull , etc . true city moment . ' m sorry hear people feel less welcome , ' ve never experience . indeed , return know face , record room stay previous trip . japanese restaurant great - avoid western restaurant back first floor , entirely forgettable .
