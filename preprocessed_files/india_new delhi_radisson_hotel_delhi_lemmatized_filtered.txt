 Dec 14 2006 	 Fantastic hotel 	 stay early December one night . need close airport due early morning flight back uk.previously stay Le Meridien Delhi comparable price . hotel far well ! lobby area huge quite impressive . several dining option well bar . opt room service instead not enough time . somewhat expensive food pretty good good selection available . this first trip India stay three hotel five day , quickly learn room quite noisy , especially standard room face front hotel . noise traffic awful . luckily book quiet room towards back hotel . slightly expensive definitely worth extra sleep ( need wake 4 am ) . room pretty big , well furnished , comfortable , good decor bathroom fine nice toiletry . could not locate safe room , despite look around room twice . think bizarre . night not issue . if need close airport want good luxury hotel - stay ! could not find hotel vicinity airport would anywhere near good one .
