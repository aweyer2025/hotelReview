's pleasant walk , lot shop , cafe eat place along way , 2 bank ( HSBC NatWest ) nearby . not fancy walking , catch bus practically outside hotel also see plenty taxis . it be true hotel situate heart London 's & quot ; arab - land & quot ; , fact several guest arab . obviously bother see shop sign write arabic , may enjoy staying area , be perfectly safe ( know fact use work nearby couple year ago , always go local restaurant cafe work ) . anything , area 's safe area London 's always busy late . husband walk back Hyde Park 11:30 night feel perfectly safe . all , friendly comfortable hotel offer high standard moderate rate ( part London ) . plush Park Lane hotel , highly recommend anyone not mind pay less & quot ; misfortune & quot ; walk extra 10 minute get hotel .
