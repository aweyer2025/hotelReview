Took Greyline shuttle airport ( great deal $ 6.50 one way , taxi much expensive due 's location far airport ) . time early check - in 11 am . quite line , go amazingly fast . not book strip - view room , ask politely inform one anyways . nice ! room : big enough , big typical non - vegas hotel room . deco quite nice relaxing , ( different crazy , loud , colorful & quot ; GO & quot ; room Flamingo ) . nice view Mirage , southward Strip , go window look , could see pool , . & quot ; GO & quot ; room gigantic wall wall window overlook fountain Bellagio , really can not beat far view go Vegas ! maybe ' ve spoil , also find window TI small side . docking station / alarm clock MP3 player room , set - up Flamingo far superior . the Casino : casino TI much big exciting Flamingo . several themed area TI 's casino , well many machine table . also fun hang playing slot get free cocktail TI Flamingo . also , TI 's player club offer we $ 10 freeplay money signing ! first night , dinner money freeplay money . sweet . the Pool : like other say , pool TI small side , tend get quite crowded . swimming lap pool , ( really want spend time Vegas ? ) like ledge around inside pool lounge , lot lot sun chair . 100 degree 3 day visit , unfortunately pool feel like 90 degree . sense , not refreshing go dip anyways . pool Flamingo probably beautiful Vegas . 's part gigantic tropical paradise waterfall , live bird , even waterslide . the Food drink : far restaurant bar go , TI easily take cake Flamingo . eat great La Isla mexican restaurant good margarita ' ve ever taste . not try hundred exotic tequila offer , ( get enough free shot Patron casino Mirage : ) ) buffet TI also top notch ! go lunch really stuff . one thing find set apart Vegas buffet lot still prepare . not go slap pasta sauce onto plate . cook behind counter make pasta fresh , mix sauce ingredient however want right . try pumpkin ravioli buttersauce pine nuts sundried tomato . Awe - some ! not try bar nightclub , be one thing Flamingo kind lack : good variety bar restaurant , not even nightclub , say .

's one cross another bridge Wynn . lobby another bridge connect directly Palazzo , house Walgreens right strip . also , neat tram go inside TI front door Mirage . be almost like one , big , combine resort need take step outside get one . consider big advantage . active people , even 100 degree heat , still manage walk way Mandalay Bay , stop air condition casino along way , course . however , quite walk , be use walk lot , be quite far . Flamingo much central strip , walk Mandalay Bay TI much managable . would give Flamingo location point , TI lot go bridge Mirage tram . Free Entertainment : Sirens TI show popular , people say , pretty aweful . nothing cast ; be try well , show stupid concept poorly write . nonetheless , free , end firework pyro effect , take place 3 4 time night . get REALLY crowd , get early , even access vip area TI room key . go 20 minute show begin already pack rafter . grab free drink casino go will fine . Flamingo free entertainment like big show sink pirate ship dance P. Cat Doll wannabe piratesse , beautiful tropical paradise , free & quot ; meet bird & quot ; type presentation morning guest learn habitat ask bird specialist question . all , TI great place stay . right amount & quot ; cool & quot ; feel , without feeling & quot ; snobby & quot ; , like high end resort Vegas . would pick TI Flamingo fun , great restaurant , large casino , & quot ; cool & quot ; factor miss we Flamingo . likely stay someplace totally new next time go Vegas , variety , two , like TI well . one insider tip Vegas visitor . good & quot ; Cirque & quot ; style show , hand , & quot ; Le Reve & quot ; Wynn resort . even see twice , amazed ! not fool fact not wear & quot ; Cirque & quot ; name . blew & quot ; & quot ; water , ( pun intend ) . see one cirque show Vegas , make Le Reve ! ! ! feel free contact question .
