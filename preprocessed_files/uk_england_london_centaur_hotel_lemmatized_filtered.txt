 Sep 14 2007 	 difficulty cancel booking 	 look budget hotel Kensington , London , book Centaur Hotel website . stupidly , forgot check TripAdvisor first ! would look review online , decide prepared risk get bad service decide cancel booking . I check small print reservation confirmation have receive email - cancellation ok make 48hrs arrival amount pre - pay refunded credit card within 5 working day . sound OK.When attempt cancel booking , hotel manager ( ) claim contract hotel ( though state clearly reservation confirmation ) agent ( b ) might charge cancel ( charge contract long cancellation least 48 hour pror arrival ) ( c ) would receive money agent would able cancel book refund money . claim speak & quot ; agent & quot ; cancel booking get refund . got & quot ; agent & quot ; actually software company buy book software . expect , nothing booking ! however , company ( Eviivo ) extremely helpful even though problem really nothing they . I think main problem hotel manager understand book software use understand payment etc process . another telephone line overhear Eviivo explain hotel manager cancel online booking ( & quot ; right - click date .... etc , etc & quot ; ) . eventually , several phone call threaten letter hotel manager , get refund process . so , although not actually stay hotel validate previous review , experience hotel management administration may influence whether choose stay .
