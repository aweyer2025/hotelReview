's probably 5 minute walk , bit . hotel kind hard find - part long strip similar look hotel , , far could tell , external sign show name hotel ( ! ! ! ) . know map print , number match , still awkward . I arrive early ( email ahead let know would ) , let check room early ( nice ) , also upgrade double single reserve . room basement , involve navigate labyrinth hallway fire door . room window open onto basically large shaft ( daylight , view anything opposite wall ) . other mention , room awfully tight , expect ( actually room overall , consider book single ) . find room clean everything good condition . problem tv first ( keep turn instead change channel ) , eventually seem start work ( stop something wrong ) . free internet access require ethernet connection , bit awkward consider small room - constrain actually use laptop . Breakfast include buffet - style service standard full breakfast . happy . meal , ok selection restaurant close Paddington ( think cheap restaurant , fancy one ) , short walk away . overall , get consider good deal ( 80 pound tax include ) , comfortable stay . discover ton hotels street , would ok stay , also might consider look other close Paddington ( one close Paddington significantly expensive traveling ) . return London day later , stay another hotel road ( high tripadvisor rating , even ) , preferred Shaftesbury Metropolitan one , several reason .

 Jan 30 2009 	 nice enough accommodation bad service 	 hotel fairly well situate central london price reasonably give location . the public area hotel clean modern . room small , least one , although double could walk around bed side . however , well appoint nice new fitting fixture . I score hotel quite low receive bad service . arrive hotel 6.30pm long day travel work . tell ( ask ) receptionist move alternative hotel elsewhere problem water supply room . say unacceptable have arrange meet colleague hotel evening also stay . extremely surly tone tell choice ' my room ' available . point not ' my room ' allocate could allocate alternative room . argument go long time time refuse let see manager refuse issue alternative room . force become equally assertive inform would hold queue people behind sorted room hotel book . although eventually back without much rolling eye , tutte general rudeness . would return hotel honour booking without struggle staff feel acceptable treat customer though inconvenience nuisance . I feel shame stay marred incident think hotel quite nice .
