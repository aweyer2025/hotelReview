super 	 Sanderson one cool hotel London , great design / cool bar . must go would say .... 
 amazing hotel 	 beautiful place , like 's sister hotel St Martin 's Lane , hip , trendy noisy ! Perfect 's sort thing be look , . lovely food well . 
 Nov 22 2009 	 Unique bit sterile . 	 hotel 's fun point : cool decor lobby , good breakfast , hip style . however , point could improve : evening noise bar lobby . lack privacy bathroom . no wall spa = noise sit room massage . ( cool . ) occasionally less helpful staff front desk . ( though mostly fine . ) get hotel part charity auction . pay lot , good cause . would not pay hotel rack rate - not seem worth . however , overall experience satisfactory . 
 Nov 20 2009 	 Quirky fun expensive 	 recently stay Sanderson good friend Suka package deluxe room . would hear Sanderson friend recommend try . pull outside hotel look like convert 60 's 70 's office building enter lobby quirky lot interesting decor item add fun ambience . arrive noon thought would try luck check luckily room available . check guy helpful even give we upgrade room treadmill - useful girl week - end last thing mind workng - come handy fling clothe ! check flew room ( via fun space lift ) drop bag please first impression upon enter room - quirky fun styling ! love big sleigh bed angle weird egg shape footstool ? footstool ? head shop get back hotel late afternoon . grab nap get ready evening ahead . two lady friend share room amenity perfect able get ready without get 's way - plenty room move actual room plus bathroom wardrobe area . once ready head long bar already pack 7.30pm Saturday night . wait several minute serve able open tab could transfer Suka restaurant eating evening . close bar tab , open new one restaurant close finish eat open new one dinner drink back long bar - something perhaps understand non resident might abscond pain b * tt resident . Suka 10 foot long bar ! Dinner Suka restaurant ok - nothing fabulous anywhere would rush back give price . ask server 's advise many dish order 2 people advise 6 - 3 starter 3 main plus 2 side . eat know portion size go advice give - turn far much could got 4 dish total without side . leave 3 dish completely untouched - waste be talk nearly £ 10 dish ! flavour presentation wise food good great - hence comment rush back . ' ve well meal local asian cuisine restaurant . after meal head back bar heaving . wait 10 minute serve work hard catch someone 's eye order drink even though appear rush foot . the bar great atmosphere - lot ' beautiful people ' none attitude . in summary stay fun expensive - suka credit room rate godsend give price meal food eat . overall cost justifiable splitting friend would struggle hand credit card one night husband would take hit together . the hotel interesting , quirky would recommend friend deep pocket . 
 Nov 14 2009 	 Pleasant Unique Hotel 	 relatively small hotel would choose , typically enjoy brass glass hotel . nevertheless , quite impressed hotel . staff superb , room nothing short immaculate , contrary comment , hotel rather quiet . sheer curtain separate section large ( even american standard ) room . room service promptly serve . would not recommend hotel family kid , be great couple business traveler . 
 Nov 14 2009 	 Appalling waste time money 	 sign Trip Advisor warn waste time money appalling establishment . expensive mistake part book night away London celebrate special occasion . staff try well however poor , high handed management ruin effort . two experience Suka restaurant bearable however room service price inedible . unfortunately wake night fire alarm , complete lack care organisation resident member staff see experience stunk alcohol- thank goodness seem false alarm !
