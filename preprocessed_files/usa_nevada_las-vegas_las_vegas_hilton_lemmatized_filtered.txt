Paradise Cafe good breakfast . as far location concern , Hilton definitely beat path far strip concern . however , monorail extremely convenient get strip rather quickly . 3 - day unlimited pass $ 40 well worth . easy go want without pay cab sit traffic . overall would say long upgrade room ok . old hotel compare other Vegas , price right think 's worth .
