 Dec 1 2008 	 Excellent Hotel ... ... ( contrarian review ) 	 wife stay Le Meridien Thanksgiving weekend . travel San Francisco day Thanksgiving nearly every year number year , see light Christmas tree Union Square decoration offering big store , range Nieman Marcus Bloomingdale 's Macy 's , Gumps , other . since hotel virtually business convention traveler Thanksgiving weekend , rate tend considerably lower normal . Le Meridien exception . as many reviewer attest , Le Meridien good hotel . argument . studio suite relatively spacious reasonably good view portion Bay Bridge Coit Tower . decorate would call upscale contemporary fairly comfortable , though would call & quot ; designer chic & quot ; & quot ; warm . & quot ; complaint ; however , several hotel ' ve stay San Francisco room approximately nice , often bit small . similarly , hotel staff , though minimal interaction , friendly efficient . my two quibble hotel thing remedied , , admittedly , least somewhat eye beholder , : ( ) location , ( b ) lack truly memorable lobby public amenity . ( ) location . Le Meridien bad location . something & quot ; blah & quot ; lackluster location . nearly mile walk ( level ground , choose right street ) Union Square , historic scenic heart San Francisco center main shopping area . taxi cost six seven dollar way include tip . also , L.M . hotel car may able take , provide book advance . thus , location relatively minor quibble , still quibble , since many good hotel compare . ( b ) lack truly grand memorable quality . Le Meridien comfortable room capable staff , lack certain memorable quality number compatriot . compare : Hyatt Regency truly grand atrium lobby ( large interior hotel lobby world , accord Guinness ) location directly San Francisco waterfront , across Ferry Building public market . Christmas decoration atrium area really attractive . ( Le Meridien rather average- sized Christmas tree , little . ) Westin Palace unforgettable Garden Court dining . the Fairmont Hotel , Nob Hill , grand enough facade feature opening close credit television series & quot ; Hotel & quot ; ( number year ago , facade interior still grand ) . together lobby feature , image grand hotel . similarly , Mark Hopkins Intercontinental Stanford Court share & quot ; top world & quot ; location Nob Hill . the Ritz Carlton facade grandeur many would say equal surpasse Fairmont . the Marriott , Westin Market Street , Westin St. Francis , Nikko , Hilton , Four Seasons , Monaco , Campton Place , Parc 55 , Grand Hyatt ( along hotel ) much close shopping restaurant scene center Union Square . many , notably St. Francis , deck regally holiday -- be practically center action . in summary , Le Meridien good hotel , comfortable contemporary room , location okay rather nondescript convenient hotel center around Union Squre Nob Hill . next time will probably pick hotel close Union Square .
