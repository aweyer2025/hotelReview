 Jan 11 2006 	 overrate 's funny ... not waste money ! 	 husband travel holiday year decide year make Shanghai . since figure probably would not make back Shanghai near future , go 10 day , decide stay hotel , Grand Hyatt fourth high building world definitely one they . since would stay 31 - Dec 1 & amp ; 2 Jan , thought would spring Bund View Suite make really special , $ 350US $ 500 australian . we take taxi Portman Ritz Carlton , hotel stay prior , find straightaway area around Pudong look boring depress , tourist stop nothing much else . when get check - in desk 54th floor , jam - pack , happy learn , since book rate club access , could check - in club floor , floor 83.We greet snooty club check - in person show suite 82nd floor . must admit , suite huge , view grand . the check - in person , course , play much possible , follow we around place full 10 minute wait tip , even though already thank make clear not go happen . normally , good tipper , however instance , person bring luggage . do check we . addition , Shanghai , 15 % service charge intend cover service , tip top would ridiculous . indeed , nobody hotel stay ( Westin & amp ; Ritz Carlton ) expect wait around tip . for heaven 's sake , already pay $ 500 / not ... downright rude person hassle us tip ! top , realize bit later bed queen size bed , pay King bed suite . point angry even bother complain . the club reasonably well - stock , pack . much ask could move chair create table could sit . staff member look put we reluctantly move chair could sit . there also many child club , run around scream stick filthy hand buffet . again , price paying , would expect little peace lounge certainly child stick hand buffet . and would expect staff well train serve guest , rather looking put it . several time different area hotel , ask staff & quot ; may help ? & quot ; , make feel question right particular area . when visit pool , one use , staff member assign sit along side watch ... could not figure ? make sure would not steal anything ? 's way feel . while view gorgeous , hotel elegant , make feel unwelcome whole time . much check two day early , stay one night , move puxhi side river near Peoples square , much centrally locate . my advice anyone think stay save money . take day trip Pudong ( be will need , be pretty boring ) drink bar Grand Hyatt , choose hotel Westin less expensive , friendly centrally locate .

 Jan 4 2006 	 Shanghai landmark worth stay 	 absolute must see destination Shanghai - even stay hotel . even high price room Grand Hyatt put consider hotel Shanghai . day two least . stay Executive Floor ( Grand Club ) - topmost floor check facility . think view service differ much decide stay couple floor standard room . room absolutely great view even well . room high clowd prevent view city time . however even walk next floor - to - ceiling window make one we afraid high place shiver . Centre Shanghai especially Pudong side city resemble Gotham City ( Batman , movie ) Jin Mao Tower hotel locate star reminder . small detail room great : heat mirrors fog take shower , light switch automatically walk room etc etc . really pay attention even small detail hotel . location : Grand Hyatt locate Pudong side city somewhat awkward location . Jin Mao Tower surround side broad motorway cross next impossible foot . underground station 500 metre hotel get problem cross street take age - dangerous . rely taxi take account get otherside Pearl River may take even 1 - 2 hour peak time . despite seemingly short distance . I prefer outdoor pool hotel provide . however indoor pool Grand Hyatt excerise room absolutely superb . remember even guest hotel constantly overlook . elevator , corridor public area constantly monitor action apper suspicious overlooker immediately get voice responce . try get opmost floor restaurant open time immediately press elevator button get voice responce & quot ; overlooker & quot ; : & quot ; Sir .. may help ... restaurant open evening ... & quot ; will see camera cenre Shanghai take good look action . shopingwise , well place Shanghai . leave lot room luggage thing end buy !

 Sep 26 2005 	 take away view 's distinctly average 	 starting review 's worth put post perspective Iappreciate 's odd comment site . first ' m someone spend every spare penny ( ) travel , privilege stay really excellent hotel Mandarin Oriental Kuala Lumpur Chedi Muscat . in fact stay Hyatt Shanghai make realise good ! though ' m far red faced western tourist bellow & quot ; native & quot ; serve beer cold enough , mean expectation set fairly highly . secondly , almost week perhaps able road test hotel breeze corporate expense account . however , take away view Hyatt , Shanghai guide book rightly rave , experience signature five star hotel top field . instead , find distinctly average . nothing major spoil break , significant chink nonetheless . take good good various area hotel : * public area hotel room deck dull , business colour , appropriate Hyatt stuff full suit . place seem well kitte variety business meeting , company business staying night two probably fine . , five star hotel much grand ( case Westin ) stylish entrance area . * staff : lot mill dark suit ear piece . however , case really mean . plenty people around whisk plate away dinner wife finish eat , one two occasion distinct lack initiative show simple request . * grand club : Hyatt , like lot 5 star hotel , make big deal club floor . staff club lounge generally helpful hotel , breakfast serve upstairs unfortunately pale imitation get ( , true , pay ) downstair main restaurant . also surprised piece paper give check fail communicate one useful perk stay club floor - free internet access business centre ( usually around USD3 15 minute ) .Do not think stay high floor give well view though . floor 80 upwards almost high . view well reception floor 54 . * health club : Hyatt small , fairly well equip gym . also separate man 's woman 's jacuzzi sauna areas pool . use pool , make wear swimming cap . 's rule 's fine ... expect everyone else same . bizzarely though second day take swim spot chinese man two kid pool . kid wear cap , man not . result , figure not either . as mention , Hyatt plenty people lurk nothing particular , pool exception . promptly ask put cap . point man , tell hair long . true , hair generally consider pretty short ! two occasion , chinese man not bother wear cap not question . one could consider ' buzz cut . ' impression leave , guy kind big wig ask swimming gear would major loss face local staff . * spa : stone massage ' Oasis Spa ' near gym wife chinese foot massage . five star hotel Shanghai Westin Marriott brand name spa attach ( case Westin , Banyan Tree ) .The impression get Hyatt add thought practitioner like enthusiastic amateur , therapist . guy give stone massage seem like masseur ( not speak English could not ask ) try pleasant , way fumble around rock not inspire confidence . spa room also right reception door open , could clearly hear people clear phlegm throat ( quite common sound China ) ! * location : great . action happen side river . road tunnel , close heavily congest 10 minute trip become 45 minute one . overhear guy say build new bar entertainment area nearby though . * view : yes , view great building architectural landmark . thing , nothing stop come coffee Hyatt . actually would recommend . Shanghai really Sci - Fi city . anywhere high seem view . in summary , Hyatt short trip business meeting nearby , hotel probably place . holiday , recommend Westin try Banyan Tree Spa . not see room , look lot nice inside less staff milling manage lot friendly helpful !
