FOOD====================================We ' think anything could worse dire room , terrible food service manage make whole experience bad ! & gt ; dinner : not dinner restaurant price honestly ridiculous . example Lamb Shank £ 15.95 , charge additional £ 2.75 side dish like potato vegetable , really include price main course . luckily find great pub Thai restaurant road , make mistake decide dessert restaurant first night . order 2 Sticky Toffee Puddings custard £ 4.75 not expect something could come straight school dinner canteen , disappointingly get . waitress pretty useless , ' bring we spoon eat pudding , go ask . ' know country , need learn ' customary UK eat custard fork . eat ( peril ) check bill carefully , witness another couple complain overcharge 3 main course 1 starter ; yet customary way eat country ! & gt ; breakfast : hotel really need let guest know restaurant etiquette , everyone guess whether wait someone seat we pick table sit . optimistically assume 4 - star hotel waitress would come take hot food order , sat wait . one come , watch people see help buffet locate end restaurant sitting . nowhere menu state system require item ( like poach fried egg ) order waitress . not guest look completely lose confused breakfast . tell people help food , feel like waiting staff ignore we . actually hear one man say wife & quot ; do deserve ? ! & quot ; also disappointed buffet food freshly cook order . regard continental breakfast , juice not chill croissant leave open door go hard stale quickly . normally charge astronomical £ 13.95 per person breakfast relieved cost include price room , otherwise would cost we almost £ 85 3 day breakfast ! restaurant never full , 2 waiting staff always look rush foot much : clear dirty plate , lay table , take food / drink order restock food crockery . feel quite sorry see one waitress drop knife floor whilst lay table , pick put straight back table ! disgusting appetite good . & gt ; ROOM service : good experience room service either . order 2 Cajun Chicken sandwich 11 pm last night . thought would come 5 minute boy speak said & quot ; yes lot Chicken sandwich & quot ; make think pre - prepared . wait 30 minute phone see take long . apparently 3 order room service time . find hard believe many people late - night munchie . 15 minute later sandwich arrive . could believe take 45 minute make couple sandwich ! plus chicken Cajun flavouring , add insult injury £ 5.95 charge sandwich . point tired hungry complain . we also notice room service tray leave corridor long time food eat . example breakfast tray still return walk 4 pm think disgraceful .
