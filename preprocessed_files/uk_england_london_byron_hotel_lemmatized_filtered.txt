's basic continental breakfast -- toast , cereal , cold cut , fruit cocktail -- fruit cocktail right , cold cut clearly package , toast almost always BARELY toast . addition , slapdash : tell desk twice ( small ) rip sheet would fix , , although three friend call trouble get several time , one point friend call tell have never check ! finally , can not speak room , mine small could not really get comfortable unless asleep . real room sit , tv / bed set - up make awkward sit bed watch TV.So sum - up would : be travel strict budget , plan day evening , not mind genuinely budget hotel , Byron bearable . afford twenty thirty pound night , go somewhere twenty thirty pound ' worth well . oh , one thing : , Americans arrive make mistake thinking could sleep three people double room . england , double room ( twin room ) mean two twin bed . want triple , need ask triple . order English breakfast . eight pound egg bacon rip - off , walk many restaurant area get real english breakfast ( egg , bacon , sausage , toast , grill tomato , maybe bake bean ) less .
