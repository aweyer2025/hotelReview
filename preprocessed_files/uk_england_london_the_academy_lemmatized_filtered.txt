Bad PointsNoisy day night traffic noise . room little shabby . look like need re - painting . stuff not really matter , ... cd player not work ( not bother ) , fan not work bathroom ( nope bother either ) . slow service breakfast ( nope holiday ) . Thought may bother people though . oh good way work breakfast go basement restaurant top floor room . watch dodgy stair ! ok , nothing fancy . quieter room would probably stay again . the chain well hotel Little Venice call Collonades , lovely .
