 Apr 11 2006 	 Las ventanas tienen 50 año ( por lo meno ) 	 estado en este hotel cuatro vece así que puedo opinar bien sobre él . Lo mejor de este hotel es lo céntrico que es . tiene la estación de metro de Great portland Street 2 minuto la de regent´s park 5 minuto . También el 90 % de los empleados hablan castellano así que tendrás problema si ere español . También tiene enchufe españole en las habitacione . Lo malo es que las ventanas tienen 50 año . verás en España esas ventanas en ningún sito . es normal que un hotel de 4 * superior tenga esas ventanas que hace que entre un frio brutal . en Abril de 2006 cuando estado yo si ponías un termómetro 20 centímetro de la ventana marcaba 14 grado con eso lo digo todo . hay que tener en cuenta que la tarifa medium de este hotel es de 120 Libras ( 180 euro ) por noche . Ese precio merece sin ninguna duda otras ventanas . Otra de las cosas que ha ido peor en este hotel es el minibar . primero si mete cualquier cosa en él te van cobrar 15 Libras ( 23 euro ) por día . como lo oyes . Segundo , el minibar es electrónico . quiere decir que si mueve algo te lo cobran . Yo lo abrí en los 3 día querían cobrar 9 Libras ( 13 euro ) ... en fin menos gastar el dinero en el minibar mas en las ventanas .
