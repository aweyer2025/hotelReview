 Apr 16 2006 	 sunny stay many shadow - would not recommend 	 stay Hotel Cavendish 3 night begin March 2006 . first , say location simply great , regard closeness everything tourist need ( attraction , food , shopping , cinemas ) safety ( female travel alone ) . head towards Trafalgar Square Victoria , bus stop step away Gower street . I one refurbish single room 2nd floor ( 206 ) , didn´t expect much space find room new nice , especially heavenly bed brandnew bathroom lot soft towel . room also flatsreend LCD TV ( SAT ) .As regard breakfast , give statement always miss . 8 - 9 morning early , find unimportant . there thing annoyed bit . first : telephone room ( although hotel description say ) ; second : arrive , tv didn´t work . ask guy reception whether could fix . mechanic come 1 hour find due maintenance work ( take place right behind room´s wall , silently ) SAT - cable wasn´t connect socket yet , fix could watch . unconnected cable also reason miss telephone room ( highspeed internet connection available ! ) also one electrical socket work . third : 10 pound deposit tv remote control , seem quite ridiculous experience tv room . fourth : nice coffee tea make facility room - , kettle doesn´t work ? ? tired complain one thing . all many small thing put little shadow sunny stay London . Don´t expect silence Hotel Cavendish , Gower Street always busy window single glass . bring earplug buy nearby boot . last least hanger wardrobe . present next guest 206 - leave hanger shopping , could management do . although definitely love area choose different hotel next time , probably Bonnington nearby price -- - .
