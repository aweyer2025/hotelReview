 Jan 8 2007 	 Esperienza positiva ! 	 Albergo fantastico consigliato per chi vuole visitare londra costi limitati almeno per quanto riguarda l'alloggio . Le camere sono davvero piccole , così come anche il bagno e la doccia però tutto è davvero pulito . Il personale è gentile e disponibile dare informazioni e soprattutto tenere le valigie nel caso si debba lasciare la stanza senza però dover partire subito . La colazione è semplice abbastanza abbondante e buona per iniziare la giornata . in definitiva è una sistemazione perfetta per chi albergo ci sta per dormire e farsi una doccia . La posizione è buona anche per chi arriva dagli aeroporti ( vicino Victoria Station ) e la zona è molto tranquilla . Consiglio l'albergo per giovani e persone senza troppe pretese .
