I would recommend hotel without hesitation . Abbiamo soggiornato al Barkston Gardens Hotel dal 6 al 13 di Agosto 2009 una doppia con servizi camera ( stanza 422 , al secondo piano con ascensore ) . La stanza era abbastanza larga , soprattutto se si considerano gli standard londinesi . Il nostro è stato un ottimo affare perché , prenotando con largo anticipo , abbiamo concordato la tariffa di 65 £ notte per camera con la colazione continentale compresa nel prezzo . Lo staff è stato decisamente gentile e nostra completa disposizione . visto che la domenica mattina la colazione viene servita partire dalle 8 noi dovevamo partire per un tour molto presto , credevamo che quel giorno avremmo perso la nostra colazione . Un membro dello staff ci ha domandato che ora avessimo bisogno di partire e ci ha proposto di scendere sala colazioni ' ora desiderata anche se il servizio non era ancora ufficialmente disponibile . e ' stato molto gentile da parte sua , noi non avevamo insistito lui ha voluto farci questo piacere . Assolutamente apprezzabile . per quanto riguarda la posizione dell ' hotel , bisogna ammettere che è ottima : la stazione della metro di Earl ' Court è davvero due passi , direi meno di 200metri . La zona è tranquilla , piuttosto turistica e infatti ci sono molti pub , ristoranti , super e mini - market aperti anche fino tardi . Questa è stata la nostra quarta volta Londra hotel di questa categoria e devo ammettere che il Barkston Gardens è stata una piacevole scoperta , il migliore rispetto tutti quelli visitati fino al momento . per concludere : ottima posizione , ottimo servizio , grande disponibilità , stanze sufficientemente spaziose , colazione servizio camera fino alle 11 di sera ( con il supplemento di 2.50 £ camera ) , buona la colazione , eccellente rapporto qualità / prezzo . Vi torneremo sicuramente . Consiglio questo hotel senza esitazioni !
